# LinkedIn profile page replica

# A complete profile page that shows my linkedIn profile and some fun information along the path.

This project uses basically HTML and CSS only. The concept of this challenge was replicate linkedIn's site with no frameworks so I could practice CSS features.
You will see that some information are fake (unfortunately I'm not Elon's friend yet), but it's only for fun, don't need to get mad at me.

# Have a look !
